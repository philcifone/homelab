2023-03-12: installed photoprism and filebrowser in separate containers, gave each 500GB on magellan for now at '/mnt/magellan"

2023-03-12: borked nextcloud, had security issues anyway. redid with proxmox helper script. 

2023-03-16: CT 100, 101, 103, and 104 have backups scheduled at 21:00 daily. Executes on HDT timezone. Set up cronjob to move backup files to gamehenge.

2023-03-17: installed more storage (catalyst, 18TB usable RAIDz1-RAID5) 4 6TB drives OWV Quad Elite Pro USB-C->USB 3.0

2023-03-24: created samba share CT with catalyst as main storage

2023-03-28: crowdsec install - attempt on PVE but repository install failed. installed on 104-filebrowser.

2023-04-08: Big day. Finally got webserver up and running. Was tricky. Debian was too out of date for Hugo and themes. Then messed up the ports, I think. Eventually retraced my steps and got nginx back on arch. /etc/nginx/nginx.conf was the culprit I belive, along with /etc/sites-available, philcifone.cc/config.toml
    106 - philcifone.cc - main ; arch container
    105 - philcifone.cc2 - "backup" of /var/www/philcifone.cc ; ubuntu container (since been removed)

2023-04-12: I was sure I misconfigured the nginx somehow, didn't know how but was sure. I think Docker messed me up. I was trying to make sure I had SSL because I wasn't sure I did. I followed the arch wiki ssl cert commands for the nginx page. Then had to comment out the https section of the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and input the correct cert file names and point to the directory (ssl/<name>). I stopped docker and now it's fixed.

2023-04-12: Added samba shares from 102 (10.0.0.7) to proxmox as storage and switched backups from local to smb, updated cronjob as well.

2023-04-16: Tried to add filebrowser to samba container but didn't like the way it ran in the foreground. Added samba to filebrowser instead for consolidation and less layers, easier access and freed up the other samba storage. Started file transfer. Will make this main copy of Gamehenge.

2023-05-05: Added admin permissions for phil@pam node user, and generated authentication keys for root@pam and phil@pam. Still cant get phil to stay logged in. I disabled root ssh login, which also disabled phil@pam ssh login for some reson. Recovery keys are also generated and stored on gamehenge. The source of authority.

2023-05-06ish: added firewall rules for proxmox and containers to prevent lateral movement. details in proxmoxHomelab.

2023-05-19: moved website to linode/akamai. Took 5 minutes, not even. Sent website files, nginx config, ssl certs, downloaded hugo, and updated A records on cloudflare. much faster, even though it's on a "nanode". They must have better internet.

2023-06-07: somehow messed up the hugo test server on the local prod CT. Shut that down, and created a new one for prod on CT 102 that pushes to linode/akamai.

2023-06-19: discovered how to attach other network storage directly to proxmox, so I have Gamehenge from MacOS connected to proxmox and am able to use that for the plex library. I may end up redoing my entire storage setup.
